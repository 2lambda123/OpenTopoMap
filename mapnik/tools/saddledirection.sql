-- FUNCTION INTEGER getdirection(Point:GEOMETRY in EPSG:900913)
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- returns the direction of a saddle at (Point) in degrees (0deg...179deg) (0:north 90:east 180:south)
--
-- Constants
--    SearchArea:   limit where the next contour line must be. (not very usefull, because bounding boxes of contour lines can be huge...)
--    SearchLimit:  maximum of examined contour lines
--    MinDescent:   minimum distance to go down the slope and search for the next lower contour line
--
--
-- Algorithm:
--    get all contour lines near the saddle
--    find the next contour line and define its height as "height of this saddle point"
--    find the next contour line which is at least MinDescent lower or higher than the "height of this saddle point", get the closest point on this line
--    get the azimuth between the saddle point and the closest point if the contour line was lower, azimuth+90deg if it was higher
--    rotate the azimuth from (N:0deg,E:90deg,S:180deg,W:270deg) to (E:0deg,N:90deg,W:180deg, the way mapserver likes angles), 180-359deg is flipped to 0-179deg
--    if something went wrong, return -1, (-1 could be considered as error flag or as "default orientation" nearly to west-east direction)
--
-- Requirement:
--    you need a database "contours" with a table "contours" with the columns "height" and "wkb_geometry" (in EPSG:900913)
--    
-- Installation
--    psql databasename < path_to_me/saddledirection.sql
--    (as owner of the database where the saddles are, eg "gis")
--    You also need to install the extension "dblink", but that you have allready done following "HOWTO_Preprocessing"

--    For "dblink('dbname=mydb', 'select ...')" you have to be superuser or you have to provide a passwort with your query. Ig you don't like
--    that, you could open the connection to countours with "dblink_connect_u('contours_connection', 'dbname=contours')" and then do your query
--    with "dblink('contours_connection','select ...')". Then you just need the exection right for dblink_connect_u.
--
--    as postgres
--     psql databasename -c "GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION dblink_connect_u(text) to username;"
--     psql databasename -c "GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION dblink_connect_u(text,text) to username;"
