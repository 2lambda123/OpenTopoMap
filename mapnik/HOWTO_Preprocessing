HOWTO create a generalized database for low zoom levels
=======================================================

A guide by der-stefan (https://github.com/der-stefan/OpenTopoMap)
http://opentopomap.org

This guide is quite complete, but you should always think before blindly copying the commands.

# Create generalized database
	createdb lowzoom
	psql -d lowzoom -c 'CREATE EXTENSION postgis; CREATE EXTENSION hstore;'
	
	
# Problems still to solve:
# Great lakes:
	# https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues/754
	# https://blog.jochentopf.com/2013-03-11-state-of-the-osm-coastline.html
# Admin centers combined with city/population

# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3195125/copy-a-table-from-one-database-to-another-in-postgres
# pg_dump -t table_to_copy source_db | psql target_db
# psql -h <host1> ... -c 'copy (select ... from <tablename> where ...) to stdout' | psql -h <host2> ...  -c 'copy <tablename> from stdin'
#### HOW IS IT DONE?? NO RELEASE OF OTM 2.0 BEFORE PROBLEM IS SOLVED.
